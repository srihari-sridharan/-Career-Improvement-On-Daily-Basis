## Triangle of Knowledge

1. List out what you know
2. List of what you know, you don't know
3. There is another list of items what you don't know, you don't know

### How to add more to "What you know?"

1. Start with item #2 - what you know, you don't know.
2. Start learning little bit every day
3. In the process of learning, you will discover more items, that were in item #3 - what you don't know, you don't know. Post discovery, those items, move to item #2. Post learning items move from item #2 to item #1.

## Learning and Taking Notes

-   Use Markdown format for notes.
-   Use Mindmaps for condensing information.
-   Use Pomodoro technique to time-box your work or learning.
-   Use Google Drive to store content that you want to be in your finger tips.

## Technical Depth and Breadth

-   Breadth - how many things do you know? Alternatives, options given something!
-   Depth - how much you know about something?
-   Keep gaining breadth, focus on depth of your core skill and gain depth in other areas as need arises.
-   You skill graph will look like an inverted 'T' where breadth is along the horizontal line and depth is along the vertical line.

## Some career tips based on my experience

These are some career tips from my experience!

#### Find a good mentor (Guru)

You always need one, especially those who follow and preach and not just preach without following! We need someone as a guiding light, to show the career path ahead! This is the most important and finding one such person is definitely a must. At times, we don't even need someone who can preach, if they follow something, we can learn from them! Remember: "It is not that the teachers teach their students, it is other way around, it is the student who learns from the teacher!"

#### Define your career path

Know your options, and choose something that will give you satisfaction and will keep you happy in the long run. Do something that you will enjoy doing day in day out! You definitely need to fix a target. Fix one, work towards it, do your best, don't be anxious about results. If you have done your duty, results will fall in place. After you reach your target, reset your target and the cycle continues.

#### Keep track of your work

Keep track of your daily work and monitor your progress. Someone is sure to ask you about what you did over a period of time! Prepare, weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual reports and send it to your reporting manager. This helps in reducing the _halo effect_. Keeping track of your work has many benefits. First of all it provides historical data, which could be analyzed to understand your strengths, weaknesses, achievements, mistakes and areas of improvement. It also helps you understand what consumes your time and whether you are doing something meaningful for your role! At the same time, it also gives you indications on whether you are progressing on your defined career path or need some course correction. Many times we get affected by _'**boiling frog syndrome**'_ and reviewing our track record helps us sense any threats sooner than later!

#### Update your resume

Please consider updating your resume (ideally once every month) whether you are looking out for a job or not! Again there is a reason why I suggest this. As humans we don't have very good memory to remember each and every thing that we did since we joined a new job. (I am assuming that you update your profile once you switch to a new job!) That said, it is easy to recollect what you did last month and update your profile. While updating your resume, consider adding stuff that you learnt, new technologies, new skills, certifications, etc. at the same time, consider removing / pruning old content / data from your resume. If not, your resume will run into pages. Please consider having a 1-2 page resume. Mention the key points in your resume and reserve the rest for an interview! For more tips, please refer to "Resume - Your Key to a Dream Job".

#### Continuous Learning

As Mahatma Gandhi rightly said "Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever." Never stop learning. Observe the industry, look at what is important and gaining more attention in your specific industry and keep yourself updated. It is good to be a generalizing specialist! Knowing something of everything and everything few things!

#### Short term vs. Long term

Define your short term and long term goals and prioritize them. When opportunities knock your door step, choose them after careful consideration. Sometimes, a job might not pay you as much as you want in the short run, but in might have long term impact / advantages in terms of learning, experience, etc. Keep your eyes wide open to identify such opportunities.

## Who is a generalizing specialist and how to become one?

### Who is a generalizing specialist? (Courtesy: The Object Primer, Third Edition)

A generalist is a jack-of-all-trades but a master of none, whereas a _generalizing specialist is a jack-of-all-trades and master of a few_.

### Continuing Your Learning Process

To become a generalizing specialist you need take advantage of every learning opportunity that you can. This article discusses a collection of techniques you can use to continue your learning process:

#### Work closely with others

One of the best ways to learn a new skill is to work side-by-side with someone that already has that skill. One of the side benefits of agile practices such as pair programming and modeling with others is that you quickly learn new, practical skills.

#### Take general introductory training

A good place to start learning is an introductory course. Professional training companies, colleges, and even conferences are very good sources of introductory training. Let your manager know that you are interested in taking training courses; that way when the budget exists you may be given an opportunity to do so.

#### Gain hands-on experience

You can read all you want, and you should, and take lots of training courses, but you do not really learn something until you try it. If you currently are not on a software project using the techniques in which you want to gain experience, then you may need to transfer to another project within your organization, find employment at another firm, or work at home after hours on an open-source project.

#### Obtain mentoring

A mentor is someone experienced with a given technique or technology who guides novices through the learning process. The best mentors have several years of experience in the technologies and techniques, mentoring experience, and good communication skills. If your organization does not have a formal mentoring process, and few do, then consider identifying potential experts yourself, and either work closely with them or ask them for help learning the new skills you need. Most people will be flattered that you asked and more than happy to help you.

#### Work in a learning team

An effective way to learn new skills is to work in a learning team, a small group of people given the task of working together to learn a particular subject. Learning teams are often asked to produce a small application for the company, perhaps something for the human resources or marketing departments. They are usually asked to spend between 20 and 50 percent of their working hours on the mini-project, devoting the rest of their time to their current responsibilities. The best learning teams are made up of people who have different skills and who are from separate areas in your systems department. Perhaps one is manager, another is systems programmer, an analyst, and so on. This wide range of skills and backgrounds enables the team to approach the learning process from several directions, increasing its learning opportunities.

#### Read, read, and read

For your learning efforts to be successful you must read, read, read. You should read a wide range of books. Read one book a month just to keep up with changes in the industry. Also read technical magazines such as Software Development and business magazines such as Fortune and The Economist (these magazines will help you to get a broad understanding of business issues). As you know the Web has a lot of great material available free of charge.

#### Take advanced training

After several months of hands-on experience under the tutelage of an experienced mentor, the next step is to return to the classroom for advanced training in specific skills. These courses will typically focus on specialized skills or technologies. For example, an advanced modeling course is likely to concentrate on analysis and design patterns, and an advanced programming course conveys a series of programming tips and tricks. The experience you have gained gives you the knowledge that you need to understand and absorb the material presented in the advanced courses.

#### Challenge yourself

If you find that you are bored, move onto something else. Boredom is a clear signal that you are not learning anything new. Challenge yourself to constantly learn new things. Do not be afraid of the unknown.

#### Communicate, communicate, and communicate

Do not take for granted that people will know what you are doing—or what you want to do. Make it known. This means marketing yourself internally and letting everyone around you know what you want out of the current - and future - positions.

The following tips should help you to improve your learning efforts:

1. **Read before attending training.** Have you ever noticed the people who come prepared to a course, who know something about the material before attending the class, tend to get a lot more out of it than people who go into it cold? My advice is to take advantage of this observation and prepare before taking any course. If possible, before you take a course ask the training instructor what they recommend you read.

2. **Recognize that you have not done it before.** It is quite common for experienced developers, especially the really good ones, to convince themselves initially that they have been doing this new stuff all along. This is because object-oriented software techniques include many important structured software-engineering principles that you likely already use. Familiarity with some of the underlying principles, those usually taught in the introductory classes and introductory books such as this one, make it easy to convince yourself that you have been doing this stuff all along.

3. **Constantly learn.** The rate of change in the IT industry is simply too fast to allow someone to train once, and then sit on his or her laurels. You should be constantly reading, taking courses, and upgrading your skills and experiences.

## Resume - Your Key to a Dream Job!

It has been a general misconception that you need to prepare your resume only when you look out for a job. Sometimes, it is even more silly, when someone asks you "Are you looking for a job change?" seeing you prepare / edit your resume. Believe me this question has come up many times in my career, and my own friends / colleagues have asked me this :-).

Now let us come to the point. Why should you update your resume and when? Ideally majority of us never bother to update the resume unless and until need arises. To answer the question mentioned above, "Why should you update your resume?" you ought to because it is your resume :-), jokes apart, we need to look into our resume and update it at least once a month or once in two months. The rationale behind updating the resume every month is to ensure that you don't miss anything important, that you achieved over a period of time. However trivial it might sound, just make a note of it, later you can knock it off if you find one that is more worthy a mention. This was you don't need to remember or recollect everything one fine day when your job search kicks off. This also ensures that none of your efforts will go in vain.

Now, content plays an important role in your resume getting shortlisted by the recruiter. Recruiters need to go through lots of resume as part of initial screening process and then shortlist the potential interview candidates. Imagine the sheer amount of resumes any company gets through various sources like, consultants, employee referrals, job portals (internal and external) and beyond all individual direct applicants. Now to win this race and to get shortlisted, your resume needs to be crisp and clear. The below mentioned tips will probably help you prepare a good resume. Also there are plenty of books out in the market which might help you write good resumes. If you need some help, post a comment, I would be more than happy to help.

#### Know your word processor

Know your word processor or editor very well. There are some really cool features in various word processors, which might be handy. Formatting and presenting the content is as important as the content itself. Hence you need to keep this in mind. Also, choose your fonts appropriately in order to ensure readability.

The resume you prepare depends heavily on the **job / role** you are targeting. Know what you want first and then try achieving your goals. This is more analogous to "I have a hammer and everything else is a nail."

#### One Page Resumes

One page resumes are really good, as recruiters will find it easy to read and know about you by spending little time. If you feel you need more pages to describe yourself, keep to a maximum of two or three. If your resume is more than that probably you are writing the screenplay for the next Hollywood flick. ;-) {Believe me I had 7 page resume when I just had two years of experience. One fine day I got an opportunity to look at the resume of my organization's Vice President and found it to be 1 page. He had so much experience and knowledge, yet was able to describe himself in a page. Eventually I prepared my one page resume.}

#### Career Objective

Have a clear **'career objective'**. This again boils down to what you want to do in the organization that you are applying for. There is something tricky here. You need to spend time and frame your career objective, this will go a long way in your career. Career objective should ideally change over a period of time as you move up the organizational ladder. There another side of the story, once I was asked to repeat my career objective by a Vice President, of one of my past organizations. This was easy as I had written my career objective. There is another school of thought from Career Cup **'no career objective'**. The company already knows that because you applied for a particular position. At best, it'll just waste space. At worst, it'll limit you since it'll exclude other positions that might have been interesting to you. Just decide based on what you want.

On the top of the resume mention your contact details like email, mobile phone, etc. Do not give too much information, just mention important stuff. E.g. one contact number where you can be reached anytime. If you are searching for a job, ensure that you are reachable anytime.

#### Experience Summary

Provide an **'experience summary'** which mentions in short about who are you and what you do currently. You can also include the list of technical areas, languages and tools that you have used. You can also mention any award or accolades that you have received. This section forms the key and should give the reader a clear picture of your skill set. They should be immediately able to make a decision without reading further. This will help them to match your resume with the job description at hand. This will also help the interviewer question you on the relevant areas. Be fair, never mention something that you do not know or do not expect to be questioned. Say if you have only theoretical knowledge and lack practical experience, it is good to mention the same.

#### Strengths

If you feel it is good, you can list down your **'strengths'**. But remember 'action speaks louder than words'.

#### Experience

After this you can mention the **'experience'** you have in you present and past organizations, in the order of present to past to first. If you had been with an organization for quite a while, mention the various roles you played, and also about the promotions that you obtained. It is also good to list down the various job responsibilities you had. This will give the recruiter a fair idea of how you progressed in your career and reached the current position. You can also mention a brief description of the projects that you worked in and the technology used.

Emphasize on the project outline and other important bits of information like roles and years, at the same time, never disclose client details.

#### Educational Details

Mention your **educational details** after your work experience in various companies. If you have got some really cool stuff like any awards, publications, etc. you can mention the same. Do not publish too much information here, anyway if needed the recruiter will get back to you. If you mention your CGPA it might be an added advantage to indicate your strong foundation. You can also mention about your subjects of interest if required, provided you have something left in your quota of 1 page. This might not be applicable once you gain enough experience.

#### Interests

Finally you can mention about your interests. This might include personal as well as professional interests, blogs, twitter, etc.

#### External References

Nowadays it is a good idea to provide links to something like **Git-Hub**, where you can showcase what you have done or contributed to the industry in return. This way your recruiter gets a chance to see that you can do something that you claim.

#### Work Permit

If you have a valid work permit or visa, just mention that you have one, without disclosing any sensitive numbers (Passport #, Visa #, etc).

#### Self Review

Above all, check your spelling and grammar. Look for typo errors, read the resume multiple times, ask someone to do a peer review, have a different set of eyes look into what you have created and let them review it. This way you will get a different perspective and it might help catch few unnoticed issues. BTW excuse me for any spelling / grammar errors in this post, as it is less than 30 mins to midnight.
